# NutriGarden 🌱

NutriGarden is a **frontend-only prototype web app** that helps users build healthy nutrition habits by turning daily nutrition tracking into a growing **flower garden**.

Each tracked nutrient becomes a flower:

* Meet your daily goals → flowers grow
* Miss your goals → flowers regress 

The app runs entirely in the browser and requires **no backend** and **no API keys**.


## Tech Stack

* **HTML** – screen-based UI
* **CSS** – fixed mobile-style layout & pixel-art garden
* **Vanilla JavaScript** – all logic, state & rendering
* **OpenFoodFacts API** – nutrition lookup (public, no auth)

No frameworks, build tools, or dependencies required.


## How It Works (High Level)

1. User enters personal details
2. Chooses **realistic goals** or **custom goals**
3. Selects which nutrients to track:
   * Hydration
   * Protein
   * Carbs
   * Fat
4. Logs food by name + grams
5. Nutrition values are fetched from OpenFoodFacts
6. Each nutrient progresses through flower growth stages
7. Completing stage 14 plants a new flower seed

## Running the App

### VS Code Live Server

This is the easiest and most reliable option.

1. Install the **Live Server** extension in VS Code
2. Open the project folder
3. Right-click `index.html`
4. Select **“Open with Live Server”**

The app will open in your browser (usually at `http://127.0.0.1:5500`).
